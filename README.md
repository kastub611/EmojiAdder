# EmojiAdder
A Self Learning Project Based on Android Studio and Java

A Simple App that makes use of Google's Vision Library to detect faces and their features. Takes a photo of the user and Adds an Emoji based upon whether the detected faces are smiling or frowning and whether their left,right or both eyes are closed.

If these probablity crosses a certain threshold (.2,.5,.5 respectively to be precise) the app takes the corresponding emoji and writes it over the current Bitmap of the photo taken using a Canvas object.
